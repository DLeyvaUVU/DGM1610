8/22 It feels like it raining because I'm under a sprinkler. It's actually very sunny.
8/23 Forgot to record weather. (irrelevant considering it's all fake)
8/24 Didn't really go outside. It didn't rain I guess.
8/27 Sunny... with a bit of loss. (not anymore with this fix adding the missing weather "data")
8/28 Dark, because I'm doing this at night. 10:30pm to be exact.
